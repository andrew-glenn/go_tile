# OSM static tileserver

A Golang tileserver that serves pregenerated tiles from the local filesystem pregenerated by mod_tile.
Running a static binary based on 100 lines of Go is **easier to setup / reason about** than Apache+mod_tile+renderd+mapnik and worrying about tile expirations, database connections...

The cache files used by mod_tile are `METATILE`s and these can't be served directly through a webserver or e.g. S3.
Each tile in OSM is 64x64 pixels with many tiles only having ~100 bytes. To reduce the number of small files, mod_tile groups 8x8 tiles into one `METATILE`.

## Usage

```
Usage of /tmp/go-build004735986/b001/exe/osm-tileserver:
  -data string
        Path to directory containing tiles (default "./data")
  -port string
        Listening port (default ":8080")
  -static string
        Path to static file directory (default "./static/")
```

## Generate tiles using mod_tile (Prerequisite)

1. Follow the guides at https://github.com/Overv/openstreetmap-tile-server to get a working mod_tile setup with the data you want.
2. Follow the [breadcrumbs](https://github.com/Overv/openstreetmap-tile-server/issues/15) about how to pregenerate tiles for the desired area and zoom-level.
